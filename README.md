### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Turan and I am a software engineer âš¡


I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with 3 years of experience working on web technologies and developing optimized end-user applications. Currently, I'm working at Deloitte Consulting as a Software/Solutions Engineer where I help clients in commercial and public sector design, develop and optimize applications to support their needs. 

I'm particularly focused and interested in developing insightful and data driven web-applications. I am an advocate for agile methodology and have used it extensively in my projects.

On a more personal level, I'm an avid football (soccer) fan, and I love watching Formula 1 races.

#### Engineering Philosophies

- **Understand the Problem:** It's easy to get lost in the details of a problem or the choice of technology or the approach but the most important thing when solving problems is     understanding the problem as completely as possible. When I'm working on an assignment, the majority of my time is spent analyzing and understanding the problem.
- **Plan Your Solution:**  Once a problem is crystal clear, I move on to planning my solution. I take as much time to ensure I have accounted for all variables and factors. I       like drawing out my solutions and discussing it with my teammates before I move on to implementation. 
- **Implement Your Solution:** If the two prior steps are done correctly, implementation should be a piece of cake. I prefer writing code that's easy-to-read and is broken down     in logical sections.
-  **Review, Refactor, Reflect:** I believe good technologies are not designed and implemented in one go. It's important to reflect back and review your code and ensure that the     functionality promised is delivered by your code. I get feedback from others in my team once I complete implementation to improve my solution and/or fix any deficiencies
